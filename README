The last straw, that's what it is. 
There are many things I can deal with in PHP.
Things that are unsavory, even.
I cannot handle using the backslash as the namespace separator in PHP code.
So, I've created this bit of protest code.
Some may call it clever, some may call it wrong, and some may call it stupid.
I call it a protest.

<?php
define('N', "\n");
print 'AND USE IT!'. \N;
// IN YOUR PHP CODE
?>
